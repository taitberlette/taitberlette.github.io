            <h1>Hiya! 👋 My name is Tait Berlette!</h1>
            <p>I am a second year undergrad mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto! All my life
                I've loved building things and taking things apart (and putting them back together... some of the time
                🤡)!</p><br>

            <p>When I was very little, I adored trains so much 💖 I would build all sorts of trains out of tissue boxes
                and toilet paper rolls,
                my grandparents had rows upon rows of shelving full of trains I had created, I was always the little
                engineer (even though at first I thought I was going to be a train engineer, I didn't yet realize how
                important building things was to me)!</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>We would always go out to watch trains pass by, particularly at this old wooden bridge by my
                grandparent's house! One day a freight train stopped just shy of the bridge to wait for a signal, and
                the engineers invited us aboard! No words can describe the joy I felt that day, being able to go inside
                and blow the horn (that's me in the red!) on a real train and seeing all the controls and panels 🫶 That
                definitely made a huge impact on how amazing I thought trains, and mechanical machinery, were, and
                fueled my passion even more! I am really grateful for those engineers who were so very kind and let us
                aboard!</p>

            <p>A large part of my life has also included building Lego, we have endless amounts of Lego bricks and sets
                laying around in bins at my home! The sets never lasted long before I had them taken apart in pieces to
                create my own designs. I also loved the Lego robotics camps at University of Ontario Institute of
                Technology (now Ontario Tech University), and I always had a blast solving problems and working together
                with others to achieve a shared goal, and learn from people! </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I became a teenager, I started to drift away from the mechanical side of things and got more into
                computer programming. For a while I actually thought I was going to pursue computer science as a degree,
                which I think is influenced from my dad, who works with computers a lot! Then I came across a video
                series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater">Ben Eater</a>, a wonderful teacher for
                understanding low level electronics, specifically his video series where he built a simple retro-style
                computer from scratch out of simple logic gates. I was so mesmerized that I wanted to build one myself,
                so I got the kit and got to work! The feeling of having something I built in my hands was far greater
                than anything I ever got programming, where it's just some code in magic computer land, nothing real...
                After that, my projects were leading more towards having hardware involved, such as the first version of
                my rotary cell phone, but still keeping the software component...
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In Grade 11 Physics, we had a final project to either create a roller coaster, or a motor, and of course
                I just had to try to build a motor! At the end of that day presenting my final project (which of course
                did not work in front of him), physics teacher gave me the push to consider engineering for my future,
                as at the time I was still contemplating computer science, but choosing engineering was definitely the
                right choice for me ✨</p>
            <br>
            <p>After that push, I attempted my first big, fully mechanical project with no electronics, the pipe organ!
                That was such a fun project to build and problem solve, and set in stone my desire to go into
                engineering, and mechanical engineering ended up being my choice as I could have all the real world
                mechanisms, while adding in some software later in the mechatronics stream!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Something very important to me is sustainability, and I have a dream to try and create a more sustainable
                vehicle than what we currently have. You can read about my attempts in my unfinished sand tricycle
                project! While I am going to keep trying, I don't know if this specific project will ever reach a
                happy complete goal, but I know I am learning a lot in my research and who knows, maybe something will
                come out of it! All I know is that in the future, I want to keep working towards making the world a
                better place any way I can.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In summary, I am someone really passionate about engineering, I always been interested in the field my
                entire life, even if I didn't know it at the time. I absolutely love problem solving
                and working towards solutions, which is even reflected in the sports I've resonated with the most,
                curling and rock climbing, both very strategic. I know I have the ability to stick through with
                something
                when it becomes hard, I'm not one to give up on a project easily, I am very stubborn.
