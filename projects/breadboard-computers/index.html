                <p>One of my first every hardware projects, after having been programming for a while, was after I saw
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU">Ben Eater's 8-bit
                        computer video series</a>, it was so crazy to me that a little computer could be built on
                    breadboards, and I wanted to learn more about how computers worked so I thought I would give it a
                    try! Ben Eater does an incredible job explaining everything going on, and I had some much fun
                    following along. At the end of his video series, I had a fully working computer, with 16 bytes of
                    memory. This video is the computer running the fibonacci sequence!

                <p>After I had finished, I wanted to expand the computer to add more functionality and be able to run
                    more complex programs. I upgraded the program counter to a full 8 bits, and I upgraded the RAM to be
                    256 bytes! My next step would have been to add a stack to get support for subroutines. </p>

                <p>I also worked on creating a little (very very slow) programmer for the computer using an Arduino,
                    with no EEPROM or other form of permanent memory, the entire computer's program had to be re-input
                    using the DIP switches every time. This came with my own little assembler!</p>

                <p>After I finished the 8-bit computer series, I had a much better understanding of how computers work,
                    and I want to try something a little bit more advanced. I saw Ben Eater's video series about the
                    6502 microprocessor (same as in the Apple II, Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System, and many
                    other retro computers), but instead of copying Ben Eater's design 1 for 1, I want to try and give my
                    own spin to it! I gave my computer 16kb of EEPROM (program storage), to hold system code, I had 32kb
                    for regular RAM, and 8kb banked RAM (with 64 banks) to hold lots of data for processing or currently
                    unused programs. I also had two 6522 versatile interface adapters, to talk to all the hardware,
                    including an LCD display, PS/2 keyboard, SD card slot, and to select a RAM bank. Instead of using a
                    full logical circuit to select which device is used at any given memory address, I instead used
                    another EEPROM to take in the top address lines, and set a bit high or low to select a device. This
                    allowed me to try different combinations of memory arrangement without redoing an entire circuit. As
                    the EEPROM program memory is so low, there is a kernel which allows programs to be loaded in from
                    the SD card into RAM. One of the programs I got working was a port of TINY BASIC, a very minimal
                    BASIC interpreter.
