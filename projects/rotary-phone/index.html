                <p>I adore retro technology so much, I love all the old mechanical sounds and buzzing and how simple
                    everything is! A project I've been working on for a while is a cell phone with a rotary dial! I've
                    been working on this project since early 2022 when I first bought a old rotary phone, but back then
                    I didn't do a very good job of documenting my work... I've made many iterations of this project, and
                    I think I am finally at a point where I am happy with it! The first four versions all used
                    Adafruit's SIMCOM 5320 module as a modem, using 3G technology. As carriers are phasing out older
                    cell tower technology, for my fifth and current version I had to upgrade to Makerfab's Maduino Zero
                    LTE which supports VoLTE and 4G data connection!</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>My first version was very simple, just a proof of concept. It had a 16x2 character LCD display, the
                    SIMCOM 5320 modem, and the rotary dial, with an Arduino Mega powering the project. It wasn't a cell
                    phone, as it had to be plugged in, but it did work! The only thing it could do was phone the number
                    input from the dial, and accept calls by dialing the number 1 on the incoming call screen. </p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The next version was fancier. I 3D printed a case and it had a battery, so it was truly a cell phone!
                    This version was powered by an ESP32 dev board and had an e-ink screen, with the same modem. I also
                    used the ESP32's touch capacitive support to add a few buttons to help navigating the device. This
                    version could call the same as the previous version, but it also had a contacts list support! With
                    the ESP32's wifi, I also had a web dashboard that could be used to edit contacts from another
                    device! The case for this phone was a disaster, just a big void to hold all the components loosely.
                    It was my first time designing a 3D printed enclosure, and it broke not long after.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>The third version was where I started making progress. This version had a colour LCD screen, and I
                    laid out everything nicely on a perf board to hold all the components! I also had a fun colourful
                    LED light ring to show notifications, progress, or other things going on! In this version, I also
                    figured out how to receive text messages, and reply with some pre-determined responses. I also had a
                    simple web server running, which let my get the weather or read snippets of my emails! A major
                    downside was the lack of any other buttons, so everything had to be done with the dial. This was
                    okay in most cases, except when I was dialing a number I couldn't backspace or accept when I was
                    done, I had a timer to submit the input after a certain period of inactivity. It also didn't help
                    that due to the timeout, if someone was reading my number or I was taking time to enter it, it was
                    possible for the number to be submitted too early, leading me to have to retype the entire thing
                    again. The phone was very massive, and hard to move around, and the limitations on the input
                    compelled me to try a new version.</p>

                <p>The fourth version of my rotary cell phone was a beast, and I went all out on the features. It had a
                    massive touch screen display, a finger print reader, a set of four full size keyboard keys with RGB
                    lights, a camera powered by an ESP32 Camera, and a solar panel (although the solar panel was more
                    just for funzies). The touch screen interface was powered by LVGL, and made using the phone so much
                    easier! Because of all the extra features I added to this version of the rotary cell phone, this
                    version was even more bulky than the last one, so it wasn't practical at all.

            <div class="text">
                <p>I took a few years break after the last version, as the modem I used in the phones (operating on a 3G
                    network), was about to expire. Late in the summer of 2025, I found a new modem by Makerfabs, which
                    had an Arduino and SIMCOM 7600 (a 4G modem!) on the same board, so I had a longing to build the next
                    iteration, trying to focus on making it as small as possible, so it would be more practical in the
                    real world! Having the arduino and modem on the same circuit board helped a lot, it meant I didn't
                    need a huge perf board to hold everything today, I just had a little one for some button inputs.
                    Other than the dial and OLED screen, the only other hardware is three buttons, and a rotary encoder
                    (which also has a button of its own), to get a full 16 inputs like an Nokia phone. The interface of
                    this phone is greatly inspired by the Nokia 3310, and borrows some pictures, fonts, and animations!

                <p>I took a lot of care to measure everything (using actual calipers this time!!) to ensure the case was
                    as compact as possible, while still being sturdy. Once I got everything together, and after some
                    trial and error, I got everything put together beautifully!

                <p>Features of this version include the regular calling, but I could also reply to text messages, using
                    predictive T9 typing inspired by the work by <a href="https://github.com/dupontgu">Guy Dupont</a>
                    and his <a href="https://github.com/dupontgu/t9-macropad-circuitpython">Standalone T9 Predictive
                        Keyboard</a>, which I translated from Python into C++, but using the same library files. There
                    is also a pretty robust web server for adding social media messaging support (right now only
                    Instagram & Whatsapp), by running a puppeteer browser instance and listening for messages, before
                    sending them to the cell phone. In addition, also via the web server, there is support for accepting
                    Duo Push authorizations, and unlocking the front door of my apartment building! I am still working
                    on this project, so there is more to come!</p>
