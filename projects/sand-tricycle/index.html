                <p>Something that I've always been thinking about is creating a vehicle powered by a greener energy
                    source, rather than what we currently have. So many people drive vehicles that either create
                    emissions as they drive, or require a great deal of effort into manufacturing their batteries. Back
                    at the end of 2023, I read an article about sand batteries, which is basically a huge mass of sand
                    that stores energy as heat, and I thought I want to try to apply that to a vehicle, so I started
                    working on this project!</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>The first step to this project was to create the sand battery that I would use in my design. I went
                    to Value Village, and got a nice big aluminium pot and some old kettles to use as heating elements,
                    and mixed it in with some sand we had in our garage!

            <div class="text">
                <p>With the kettle heating elements, I was able to get the temperature up to about 260 degrees Celsius,
                    when powered by a 120 volt outlet with the kettles in series (as heating elements are basically just
                    big resistors designed to emit heat).</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>With the proof of concept working, I wanted to try and retain more energy, so I added some insulation
                    to the aluminum pot and added a bunch more sand to top it off. I had a lot of trouble with the
                    wiring, all the insulation from the wires would always melt off or start burning, I got it sorta
                    working with electrical tape, but it could only go so far towards the sand before it started
                    melting. I also didn't have a way to insulate the top, so that would definitely be a point for
                    improvement, but so far I had not made it far enough into the project for that to matter. Also, the
                    insulation I had was only good for up to about 220 degrees I think, and the inside layers were
                    burning, so this layout wasn't going to work.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The next thing I tried was to use a cast iron pot, as it should be better at retaining heat compared
                    to aluminium. In addition, apparently (who could have guessed), kettle heating elements only
                    designed to heat water up to 100 degrees Celsius for a short period, are not great at withstanding
                    over 250 degrees Celsius for long periods of time, and all three eventually started crumbling and
                    breaking, so I made the switch to an electric stove top heating element from Home Depot! </p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Now that I had a decent source of heat, or at least one that could get me by, I started looking at
                    ways to extract this energy. The original way I was thinking about getting this energy was with
                    Peltier modules, which contain an alternating lattice of metals, where when a temperature difference
                    is applied, electricity flows through the circuit. </p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <p>I originally just started with four Peltier modules, but that was not nearly enough power I need to
                    power a motor, or even an LED light, so I got some more. There was still nowhere near enough power
                    to get a motor going, but at least I got an LED powered only off of thermal energy!</p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The problem with Peltier modules, that I didn't realize when I started working on this project, is
                    that they are SO inefficient, below 10%, so a large portion of the heat I had was wasted, so I don't
                    think I'll be using them again. The next thing I want to try is using a stirling engine, which is a
                    heat powered engine that directly converts thermal energy into mechanical motion, without first
                    converting to electricity! I thought that using a stirling engine would work much better, but back
                    in Grade 12 I did not have the skills or the knowledge to build and manufacture one myself, so I
                    took a pause from that project. Two years later, now at the end of 2025, I have much more knowledge
                    about design and manufacturing from my first year and a half at UofT, and I am feeling ever more
                    confident in my ability to work on this project again soon!</p><br>
                <p>I don't know if anything will ever come from this project, I know a lot of people have researched
                    stirling engines in the past (including NASA!) and not much has been done with them in the real
                    world, but who knows, maybe I'll get somewhere! Even if this project is a failure in the future, I
                    am still learning lots of valuable skills and making an attempt.
                </p><br>
                <p>I am hoping to work on this project again in the summer of 2026, after I have learned about
                    thermodynamics after my winter semester in second year!</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Even though I didn't get the energy output I wanted, I still mounted it to the tricycle to see if
                    anything would happen, and it did! It was just so weak 💔 But better than nothing!!</p>
