                <p>This was a project I did for the Whitby Curling Club, which was an idea by my boss to help new
                    curlers practice their shots! Normally when you are curling, you have another person at the other
                    end to help you line up, but when you are practicing alone it is more difficult. Some curling clubs
                    have string under the ice for different possible angles, but it can get messy very fast, any may be
                    confusing to figure out which one they want to follow. The idea was to use LED lights instead of
                    string, so different angles can be selected and lit up at any certain time, leaving only one or two
                    "visible" at a time to make it easier to remember what you are doing!</p>

                <p>The first revision attached to a regular LED light controller, and used switches to selectively
                    connect or disconnect the power to a specific light strand. It was definitely a prototype, and a
                    major weak point was the connection between my perf board and the existing LED light controller,
                    which after a long time with forces applied, not in its ideal resting position, caused the connector
                    to stop holding on to the plug. </p>

                <p>The second version included a custom circuit board, rather than a perf board, and connected directly
                    to the power source, not relying on the external LED driver. It was also expanded to support up to 6
                    LED light stands!</p>
