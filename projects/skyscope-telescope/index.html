                <p>In 2024 I went to HawkHacks at the University of Laurier, and three other people and I built a
                    telescope that could automatically align itself to look at stars or planets, called <a
                        href="https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/hawkhacks/projects/clwdewjpl0dljuc0145ylzz1k/idea">Skyscope!</a>
                    My role on our team was to work on the 3D printed attachments and motor controls for the telescope,
                    which was a second hand telescope we found on Facebook Marketplace. I also worked on getting the
                    current position of the telescope using an Arduino (before we fried it and let the magic smoke out)
                    and a mobile phone tapped to the telescope. The motors were controlled by a VEX robotics kit we
                    borrowed from my highschool. My teammates worked on a beautiful website for selecting what the
                    telescope should be looking at in the sky, and also the math behind determining which angles the
                    telescope needed to point at from the skyfield Python API. The entire project can be read about on
                    the link above! In just a short time frame, of just 36 hours, we were able to work together
                    effectively to achieve a shared goal, building off our individual strengths!
