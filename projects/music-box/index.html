                <p>A project I worked on the summer of 2025 was an automated music box! I've always seen videos and
                    photos of wonderful mechanical music machines, like fairground pipe organs! </p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>I got a simple paper tape music box, and I determined the dimensions of the gears it used, so I could
                    3D print a custom gear to connect to the original gear train. I was originally thinking about
                    creating the entire thing out of 3D printed parts, but I realized it would be a lot easier to
                    prototype using Lego (which I still have a lot of!) so the gear I designed had a hole to fit around
                    a Lego Technic axel! I ended up loving the look of the Lego so much that I decided to keep it in the
                    final design! I also printed some custom Lego pieces to clamp some plates onto a wooden frame, and I
                    printed some Lego compatible gears!</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>I also wanted to make it a bit of an art piece, in the bottom half I wanted to create the effect of
                    "waves" using popsicle sticks on a crank shaft and a slider, each offset by a little bit. The wave
                    mechanism was connected by a belt and pulley to the rest of the music box mechanism!</p>
                <p>I wanted to make the music box wall powered, so I took apart a Lego Power Functions motor that was
                    acting up, and I wired it to a buck-boost converter to control the voltage from a wall power supply.
                    By changing the conversion ratio in the buck-boost converter, the speed or tempo of the song can be
                    changed!</p>
                <p>The first song I punched into the paper tape was a bit of the song "Murph" from Interstellar!</p>

                <p>My music box project shows my ability to plan out a project and commit to a design, and decide and
                    complete a project within a specific timeframe, as I only had two months to work on this project
                    before I headed back to school!</p>
